# Phylogenetic tree multiset completion in the context of supertrees

This project introduces an innovative method for completing multisets of phylogenetic trees by minimizing the addition of new taxa while maintaining key evolutionary signals. Building on existing tree completion techniques, it incorporates consensus maximal completion subtrees and combined branch length data to enhance the process. This ensures that the completion is both biologically relevant and computationally efficient. Each tree in the set is iteratively completed by adding missing taxa using consensus subtrees derived from overlapping information in the other trees. The outcome is a collection of completed trees that serve as a foundation for creating multiple comprehensive consensus trees, which provide a cluster-based depiction of alternative supertrees.
